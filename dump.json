I was in the area this morning so could have met with one of your reps. Alas, that opportunity has passed.

There are many fiber cement and vinyl siding contractors offering to complete siding projects; however, only a select few can provide unparalleled customer service like Chip&rsquo;s Roofing &amp; Exteriors.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Two of the most popular types of siding used on houses today in Denver, CO are fiber cement composite siding and vinyl siding. Installing a siding correctly can be difficult, so it is extremely important to hire professional contractors. Our fiber cement and vinyl siding contractors have the skill and expertise to confidently offer you superior siding replacement and installation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Find The Benefits Of Fiber Cement Siding</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Many vinyl siding contractors consider fiber cement siding to be the best for use in mountain areas and fire hazard severity zones because it has a class five fire rating. It is an excellent alternative to vinyl and wood siding; its popularity is growing these days.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Fiber cement siding is made from 90% concrete, 7% fiber, and 3% of other materials. It&rsquo;s like ceramic, but it is soft and can flex with your wall. Unlike popular wood siding, fiber cement siding provides the ultimate protection from water damage, deterioration, and termites. Moreover, it stays like new for 20 years, so you don&rsquo;t have to paint it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>\r\n  With our affordable siding solutions you can have a beautiful, maintenance-free home and never have to pick up a paintbrush or climb shaky ladders again!\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>Advantages Of Vinyl Siding</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Vinyl siding is the most affordable siding on the market. It is made up of 80% PVC resin and 20% of materials that impact color, resistance, and flexibility. A big advantage of vinyl siding is that it never has to be painted. The color is melted all the way through it, so even the hardest hail can&rsquo;t cause any damage; however, the color will start to fade after 20 years.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"page-images single-image\">\r\n  <img alt=\"\" data-crop=\"\" data-id=\"37\" data-source=\"/media/page_photos/0000/photo_37.jpg?_=1543389049\" height=\"576\" sizes=\"100vw\" src=\"/media/page_photos/0000/photo_37.normal.jpg\" srcset=\"/media/page_photos/0000/photo_37.wide.jpg?_=1543389049 1024w, /media/page_photos/0000/photo_37.normal.jpg?_=1543389049 800w, /media/page_photos/0000/photo_37.mobile.jpg?_=1543389049 480w\" width=\"1024\" />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Where Can I Find The Best Siding Contractors Near Me?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Chip&rsquo;s Roofing &amp; Exteriors can help you eliminate the hassle of maintaining your home&rsquo;s exterior.

As one of the most <a href=\"/roofing-company/\">experienced roof companies</a> in Denver, CO, Chip&rsquo;s Roofing understands how vital is to keep a property&rsquo;s roof in good condition. We offer professional roof inspection services to commercial and residential properties.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Sometimes, it is hard to determine whether your roof needs maintenance or not. Only a certified roof inspector is able to inspect your roof properly. Therefore, reducing the need for unwanted emergency repairs. We&rsquo;ve prepared a list of the ten most common reasons why you should get a roof inspection:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <strong>You rarely clean trash and debris from your roof. </strong>If you neglect the routine cleaning of your roof, you might have leak problems. Trash and debris deter normal roof drainage.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <strong>Extreme weather conditions.</strong> It is always a good idea to get wind and hail damage roof inspection after severe weather events. In our experience, even roofs in perfect condition have leaks after heavy rains or hails.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <strong>Building&rsquo;s continuous improvements.</strong> As a homeowner or facility manager, you may want to upgrade your building from time to time. A certified roof inspector will show you all the possible ways to improve your roof.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <strong>Damage from maintenance works.</strong> Sometimes, workers who maintain your house or facility can damage your roof. New HVAC systems, satellite dish repair, or security system check - it doesn&rsquo;t matter; after any maintenance work, roof inspection is highly recommended.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <strong>Weather and age. </strong>Regular roof inspections can help determine weathered areas to prevent further damage.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <strong>Flora and fauna damage. </strong>Plants and animals can also damage your roof. Birds, for example, can bring various seeds and spores onto your roof causing leakages.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <strong>Drainage system performs poorly.</strong> Your drainage system keeps water out of your roof. If standing water is the main reason of leakage, it can spread over a large area.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <strong>Security.</strong> Unlocked or damaged skylights and hatches are easy targets for burglars. Roof inspectors can spot security breaches and fix them.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <strong>Roof warranty issues.</strong> The majority of roofing companies offer the warranty on their work. It is hard to know whether to file the warranty claim or not without a professional roof inspection.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <strong>Create an inspection schedule.</strong> It is easy to forget the things that you see twice a year. By scheduling an inspection plan with your roofer, you reduce the trouble of keeping too many things in your head at once.\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why Should I Call For a Roof Inspection Service?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  A regular roof inspection is an excellent way to keep your roof in&nbsp;great condition and save money in the long run.

Our goal is to give your windows a factory-finish look and feel.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Our window painters will work with you to choose the perfect solution for your exterior configuration. Whether you have standard or custom-made elaborate windows, we offer a variety of colors and will help you find the perfect one for your specific style and taste.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Seven Signs A Home Needs Services By Professional Window Painters</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  When it comes to preserving your home&rsquo;s look and value, your windows play a major role. Freshly painted windows not only give your building visual appeal, but they also provide a coating that protects your house. &nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  If you are not sure when it is time to give your window frames a new, beautiful look, Chip&rsquo;s Roofing &amp; Exteriors has compiled seven clear signs that you need the help of professional window painters.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"columns\">\r\n  <div class=\"column column-left\">\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <strong>Peeling Paint.</strong> Strong sunlight, cold winters, or humidity greatly contribute to peeling. When paint peels off, it makes your home appear old and unkempt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <strong>Bubbling and cracking.</strong> Spidery cracks and bubbles on a painted surface of your wooden or aluminum window frame is the result of hail, UV rays, or sandy wind. &nbsp;\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <strong>Aging. </strong>Most paints have life expectancies. To avoid the aging and deterioration of your exterior, re-paint your house every five to ten years.\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <strong>Fading. </strong>Because of bleaching and water intrusion, exterior paint fades.\r\n      </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"column column-right\">\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <strong>Chalking.</strong> When you run your hand over the window frame and it leaves a powdery residue, it is a sure sign of chalking.\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <strong>New House. </strong>Yes, that&rsquo;s right. Usually, new buildings get only one layer of paint to protect the exterior. Professional window painters know that a single layer of paint is insufficient to protect your home for a long time.\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        <strong>Rotten Wood. </strong>If the wood on your window frame feels spongy and soft, you need to call Chip&rsquo;s Roofing &amp; Exteriors as soon as possible to prevent a big problem in future.\r\n      </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Where Can I Find Experienced Window Painters Near Me</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Are you still looking for the best window painters near your location?

As boring as roof inspection, roof repair, and roof replacements may seem to be for a homeowner, they are some of the most critical elements to the upkeep of your biggest asset.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Your home is probably the biggest purchase you will ever make. Don&rsquo;t let it go unnoticed until it&rsquo;s too late and an expensive roof repair or an entire roof replacement is your only option. So, when should you replace your roof?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Roof Inspection</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  First things first&ndash;inspect your roof. From the ground! Good eyes, and maybe a set of binoculars, are all you need. Walk the perimiter and see what can be seen. Obvious lack of maintenance can usually be spotted right away. If your roof is older get a professional roofing contractor to do an inspection. If it&rsquo;s a newer roof and you notice any of the issues listed above or there has been a severe storm (so common in Denver!) also call a professional roofing contractor. Luckily Chips Roofing offers free roof inspections.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Warning Signs You Need a New Roof</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Age of the roof. A typical roof can last 20 plus years. There are many factors that greatly reduce that time. Colorado weather is one of those factors. Wind, hail and more are standard storm weather in Denver. This can cause premautre wear and tear on your roof.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Water damage. Water happens. One small leak, an ice dam, or even improper roof installation or repairs from an unqualified roofer and you could find yourself with a hefty roofing bill!\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Visual Signs. A good visual inpection can catch quite a bit. You&rsquo;re looking for warped or cracked shingles, missing or slipping shingles, cracked or missing caulking, worn out rubber boot or pipe vents, damaged or ill-fastened roof gutters, moss or stains that could signal water damage.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Inspection. As previous stated, nothing can replace an experienced and knowledgeable roofing contractors inspection. Let a roofing expert examine it. A trusted roofer can prove invaluable.\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Repair or Replace Your Roof?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Should I Replace or Repair My Roof?
